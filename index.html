   <p><span class="n">MISSION BRIEFING: We are sending you to a city with one of the fastest-spreading infection rates on earth. But the strain is not only spreading quickly - it's also mutating, with new symptoms every week.</span></p>
   <p><span class="n">Raxxon is in the area running the containment plan. We need you to work with them, and their quarantine facility may be especially helpful to stop the spread. But the rumors that Raxxon might be messing with the virus thesmselves is troubling. Don't be surprised if the disease seems to mutate faster as Raxxon's power grows.</span></p>
   <p><span class="n">We have little hope that those infected in the area will ever be saved. Get the healthy population out of there and live to fight another day.</span></p>

   <p><span class="n">MISSION BRIEFING: We at Raxxon regret to inform you that the previous methods you were using for distinguishing between healthy citizens and those in the early stages of infection may have been less than 100% accurate. Recent studies have shown that the VirusChecker 3000 was giving a false negative on 50% of patients who at first seem healthy.</span></p>
   <p><span class="n">In addition to current protocols, we'll need to you administer a survey of questions to citizens who seem healthy to ensure they are have not been in contact with the virus in the past week.</span></p>
   <p><span class="n">And just to be sure, if they DO admit contact with an infected, administer these pills, which, if they are infected, will accelerate the symptoms to help make sure we don't leave any infected on the street.

<h3>Setup</h3>
   <p>Set up the game for Regular difficulty, with the following changes:</p>
   <ol>
	   <li>Place all 3 celebrity healthy cards in the game box. They will not be used for this scenario.</li>
	   <li>Deal out only 9 random infected cards facedown to be added to the population.</li>
	   <li>Separate out the 15 hostile healthy cards and the 3 susceptible healthy cards. Shuffle those 18 cards together with the 9 dealt infected cards to create the 27-card Population Draw Pile.</li>
		   <li>Deal out 9 more random infected cards facedown. Shuffle them together with the 9 remaining healthy cards (familiar, family, and innocent) to create the 18-card Infection Check deck. Place it near the game baord.</li>
		   <li>Shuffle the remaining 12 infected cards to create the Infection Supply.</li>

	</li>
	<li><strong>Unchecked Healthy Cards:</strong> Hostile and susceptible cards (all 18 healthy cards that start in the population) are considered to be infected for the purpose of the evacuation actions and cannot be moved to the evacuation pile due to any game effect. </li>
	<li><strong>Check a Healthy Card:</strong> As an additional action considered to be just below each player's character sheet, players may check a population card. To check a card, choose a healthy rioting or susceptible card face-up in the crowd and return it to the game box. Then draw the top card of the Infection Check Deck and place it face-up in the spot where the checked card was. Then immediately resolve any <span class="rxico flip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></span> effects on the new card.
		<li><strong>Check Limits/Consequence:</strong> There is no limit on the number of tokens that can be placed below each character sheet in order to take the Check action.

	 	<li><strong>Stubborn Hostile Cards:</strong> Hostile cards are not considered healthy for the purpose of Evacuate actions. This means that hostile cards are not fit for evacuation and cannot be targeted by Evacuate cards.</li>
	 	<li><strong>Enhanced Crowd Control:</strong> When using any crowd control action, INSTEAD of resolving the listed effect, the player may "calm" 1 face up hostile card, meaning that those hostile cards are set aside in a hostile supply and the top card of the non-hostile supply is put in the crowd face-up in its place. So in order to win, players will need to first calm and then evacuate each of the 15 healthy cards in the population.
	 		<li><strong>Rising Tensions:</strong> During End of Day, when the entire crowd is flipped face-up, hostile cards left in the crowd incite those near them. Move all non-hostile healthy cards that are adjacent to 1 or more hostile cards back on top of the non-hostile supply and replace each with a card from the hostile supply.</li>
	 		<li><strong>Evacuation Consequence:</strong> The Evacuation consequence which moves hostile cards from Evacuation to the Population Discard Pile is replaced with the following: "Move a card from the hostile supply to the Population Discard Pile, and a card from the Evacuation Pile to the heatlhy supply."</li>

	     <p>Raxxon releases all but carrier patients from Quarantine to focus on the task at hand. <strong>Move all non-carrier cards from both quarantines to the population discard pile.

	     <p><strong>From now on, whenever you use a Quarantine action on a carrier infected card, instead of placing it in quarantine, place it in the evacuation pile. You now win the game when all 20 healthy cards are in the evacuation pile, and all 10 carrier cards are either in a quarantine pile or in the evacuation pile.</strong></p>
